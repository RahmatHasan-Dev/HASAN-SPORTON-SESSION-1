# FYEP Programming Project – Next.js Web Application

This project is developed as part of the **Final Year Engineering Project (FYEP)** under the **Programming** category.  
The system is built using **Next.js** to demonstrate the application of modern web development technologies in solving real-world problems.

---

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to design and develop a web-based application that addresses issues related to **[jelaskan domain masalah, contoh: data management, automation, monitoring, etc.]**.

This system provides an efficient, scalable, and user-friendly solution by leveraging modern frontend and backend technologies.

The project focuses on:
- Developing a responsive web application
- Implementing core system functionalities
- Applying best practices in software development

---

## Problem Statement

Many existing systems suffer from several limitations, such as:
- Manual and inefficient processes
- Lack of real-time access to information
- Poor user experience and scalability issues

Therefore, a web-based solution is required to improve system efficiency, accessibility, and reliability through automation and modern web technologies.

## System Architecture

The system follows a client-server architecture:
- The frontend is built using Next.js with server-side and client-side rendering.
- API routes handle business logic and data processing.
- The database stores persistent application data.

---

## Features

- User-friendly and responsive interface
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
- Secure data handling
- Modular and maintainable code structure
